# Learnyounode Solutions

These are my solutions for the Learnyounode tutorial available [here][LearnyounodeLink].  In the comments, there are several solutions and the official solution.  The blog posts have reference links to the relevant Node and Javascript docs.

* The solutions for all the exercises are included in the repo with comments, even though the blog series is still being completed.


# Who will this help?

The Learnyounode tutorial is a very good introduction for beginner or expert web developers.  A prior knowledge of Javascript is required.  Nodeschool also has a good Javascripting tutorial available on their [page][javascriptingLink].  Another good Javascript resource can be found at [w3schools.com][javascriptW3].

- Solutions are provided with comments and some alternate solutions.
